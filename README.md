Implementations of:
   1. Primes factorization
   2. Primes reduction
   
## Primes factorization
Writing a number as a product of prime numbers is called a prime factorization of the number.
The terms in the product are called prime factors.

## Primes reduction algorithm:
Given an input x:

1. If x is prime, print x and stop

2. Factor x into its prime factors p1,p2,…,pk

3. Let x = p1+p2+⋯+pk

4. Go back to step 1
